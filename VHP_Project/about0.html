The Veterans History Project of the American Folklife Center collects, preserves, and makes accessible the personal accounts of American war veterans so that future generations may hear directly from veterans and better understand the realities of war.

The VHP’s extensive archives are preserved in the Library of Congress and made accessible through a searchable, online data base.
