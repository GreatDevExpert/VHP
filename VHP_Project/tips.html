<p><b>Tips for a great interview:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Conduct background research on veteran’s war/experiences.</li>
    <li>Conduct a practice interview.</li>
    <li>Share with the veteran the kinds of questions you'll be covering. The biographical form can help give a preview.</li>
    <li>Never record secretly.</li>
    <li>Encourage the veteran with nods rather than sounds.</li>
    <li>Don't begin the interview with painful or controversial questions.</li>
    <li>Be patient and give the veteran time to reflect before going on to a new question. </li>
    <li>Use follow-up questions to elicit more details.</li>
    <li>Consider asking the veteran to show you photographs, commendations, and personal letters to provoke stories.</li>
    <li>Be yourself. Try to keep your opinions out of the interview and don't pretend to know
        more about a subject than you do.</li>
